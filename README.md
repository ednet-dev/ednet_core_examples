# ![Alt dartling](https://raw.github.com/dzenanr/dartling/master/resources/dartling.png) **examples**

## Categories: MVC, dartling

## Description

The dartling_examples project is just a collection of separate
[EDNetCore](http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/dartling) (version 2.0.0) examples
(Dart Editor applications).

After cloning dartling_examples, open each example separately in Dart Editor.

The dependencies in the pubspec.yaml file of each example are on the 
last versions of dartling and ednet_core_default_app on GitHub.
You should have git installed on your computer and Dart Editor should be
able to find 
[where](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qFQvvqBkIpvfp3T3vFonRAGb4RLUIFu3w8cxh2j0sVg/edit?usp=sharing).
If you want to change them to paths on your computer or to the Pub of Dart,
consult the generated doc/pubspec.txt file for an example.
