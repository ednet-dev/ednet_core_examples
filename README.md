## Description

The ednet_core_examples project is just a collection of separate
[EDNetCore](https://github.com/ednet-dev/ednet_core) (version 2.0.0) examples
(IDE applications).

After cloning ednet_core_examples, open each example separately in IDE.

The dependencies in the pubspec.yaml file of each example are on the 
last versions of EDNetCore and ednet_core_default_app on GitHub.
You should have git installed on your computer and IDE should be
able to find 
[where](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qFQvvqBkIpvfp3T3vFonRAGb4RLUIFu3w8cxh2j0sVg/edit?usp=sharing).
If you want to change them to paths on your computer or to the Pub of Dart,
consult the generated doc/pubspec.txt file for an example.
